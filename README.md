# Italy statistics simple analysis

## Motivation

I was preparing my travel to italy and because i needed to find a place to live, i also wanted to know quite a bit more the population of some cities in a visual way.
I thought that it was a good opportunity to do a little app for viewing that data and download it.
At the first i had to use the data from the public census of 2019, but after i did make a scrapper that saves the data from comuni-italiani.it
